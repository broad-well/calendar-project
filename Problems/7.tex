	\textsf{\textrm{\textit{GUIDANCE}} is a regular octagon
		with center $O$. We define $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$
		as counter-clockwise rotations of, respectively, 45\textdegree, 90\textdegree, and 135\textdegree \space about $O$. Which diagonal will be mapped onto $\overline{CI}$ if each rotation is applied exactly once?}

	% Reasoning
	\paragraph{Reasoning}
	\begin{quotation}
	
	It can be deduced from the Angle Addition Postulate (1) that Euclidean rotation angles are accumulative (i.e. two 45\textdegree \space rotations $\equiv$ one 90\textdegree \space rotation), which means that applying all of the given rotation angles exactly once is equivalent to \textbf{one} $45+90+135=270$\textdegree \space counter-clockwise rotation. This is equivalent to one $360-270=90$\textdegree \space clockwise rotation because one full rotation is $360$\textdegree. Given that \textit{GUIDANCE} is a regular octagon, the 8 segments connecting its center to its vertices divide the full rotation around its center into 8 central angles (i.e. $\angle NOA$). Since each central angle of a regular $n$-gon has a measure of $\frac{360\textdegree}{n}$, their measures in $GUIDANCE$ are equal to $\frac{360}{8}=45$\textdegree. Coincidentally, the deduced angle of the rotation to be performed has a measure of $45\cdot2=90$\textdegree, indicating that each vertex will map onto one that is $\frac{90}{45}=2$ sides away (i.e. $D$ to $U$). Making a $90$\textdegree \space counter-clockwise rotation from $\overline{CI}$ determines the  diagonal that would map onto its position after the $90$\textdegree \space clockwise rotation; after such application, $\overline{CI}$ maps onto $\boxed{\overline{AG}}$, which is the solution to this problem.
