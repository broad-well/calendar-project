		Since it is given that the parabola $y=x^2$ is intersected at $A$ and $B$, these points lie on the parabola and thus fulfill the equations $y_1=x_1^2$ and $y_2=x_2^2$. Using the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ can be represented by the expression $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$, which is given to be equal to $8\sqrt{5}$; both sides are multiplied by themselves to produce to equation $(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2=320$. Given that $y_2=y_1+16$, $y_2-y_1=16$ when both sides are subtracted by $y_1$, and $y_2-y_1$ can be substituted as $16$ in the equation derived from the Distance Formula, which can be simplified: $(x_2-x_1)^2+16^2=320=(x_2-x_1)^2+256$; after subtracting both sides by 256, $(x_2-x_1)^2=64$ and thus $x_2-x_1=\sqrt{64}=8$. The variables are then determined below:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{l | l}
				$y_1=x_1^2$, $y_2=x_2^2$, $x_2-x_1=8$, $y_2-y_1=16$ & As derived above \\
				$x_2^2-x_1^2=16$ & Substitution \\
				$x_2=8+x_1$ & Add both sides by $x_1$ \\
				$(8+x_1)^2-x_1^2=16$ & Substitution \\
				$(64+16x_1+x_1^2)-x_1^2=16$ & Expand the squared term \\
				$64+16x_1=16$ & Simplify \\
				$16x_1=16-64=-48$ & Subtract both sides by 64 and Simplify \\
				$x_1=\dfrac{-48}{16}=-3$ & Divide both sides by 16 and Simplify \\
				$y_1=(-3)^2=9$ & Substitution and Simplify \\
				$x_2=8+(-3)=5$ & Substitution and Simplify \\
				$y_2=(5)^2=25$ & Substitution and Simplify
			\end{tabular}

		The slope of line $p$ can be determined using the slope formula: $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{25-9}{5-(-3)}=\frac{16}{8}=2$. Given that point $A(x_1,y_1)$ lies on line $p$, the line can be represented using an equation in point-slope form: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1) \Rightarrow y-9=2(x-(-3))=2(x+3)$. Using the distributive property, $2(x+3)=2x+6$. For $y-9=2x+6$, adding 9 to both sides yields $\boxed{y=2x+15}$, the solution to this problem.
