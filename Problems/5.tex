	\paragraph{Introduction to Derivatives}
	\begin{quotation}
	Google defines the Derivative as ``an expression representing the rate of change of a function with respect to an independent variable.'' In a graph of $y=f(x)$ on the coordinate plane, a Derivative refers to the instantaneous slope with respect to $x$. 
\end{quotation}

	\paragraph{Introduction to Integral Calculus}
	\begin{quotation}
		This problem is a typical application of the classic ``area under a curve'' problem that introduces many students to Integral Calculus.
		
		Consider the area of the {\color{green} green} rectangles above as an approximation of the area under the parabola $y=x^2$ from $x=-1$ to $x=1$. This is an application of the Riemann Sum. Let the width of each rectangle be $\Delta x$; since the area formula for a rectangle is $wl$ where $w$ is its width and $l$ is its length, the area of one such rectangle can be expressed as $x^2\Delta x$ where $x$ represents its horizontal displacement from the $y$-axis. As such, the approximate area under $y=x^2$ bounded by the $y$-axis and $x=g$ can be expressed as $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\frac{|g|}{\Delta x}}(n\Delta x)^2\Delta x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\frac{|g|}{\Delta x}}n^2(\Delta x)^3$ where $g$ is a multiple of $\Delta x$. To represent the exact solution, $\Delta x$ must be infinitesimal; thus the exact area is $\lim\limits_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\frac{|g|}{\Delta x}}n^2(\Delta x)^3$.

	\paragraph{Reasoning}
	\begin{quotation}
	
	The complement of the condition that \textit{``at least 1 six appears''} is that no six appears, which has a probability of $\frac{\textrm{\small{favorable}}}{\textrm{\small{all possible}}} = \frac{5}{6}$ for 1 roll (1). Since it is given that the die is tossed 6 times, and since this negated condition requires \textbf{all} rolls (not just one) to not be six, the cumulative probability for this negated condition is $(\frac{5}{6})^6 = \frac{5^6}{6^6} = \frac{15625}{46656}$ (3). This result's complement, the solution to the problem, is $1-\frac{15625}{46656} = \boxed{\frac{31031}{46656} \approx 0.665}$ (2)
